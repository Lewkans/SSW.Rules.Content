Would you trust a lock that has never been tested? Cybercriminals are always looking for weaknesses — are you confident your systems can keep them out?

At SSW, we take security seriously by bringing in external penetration testers to rigorously assess our systems, uncover vulnerabilities, and ensure we're always one step ahead of potential threats

### What is Penetration Testing?

Penetration Testing is a **simulated cyberattack performed by security professionals** to **evaluate** the **security** of the services, systems, and networks of an individual or company. It helps companies identify vulnerabilities in their security systems, access the potential impact and damages, and steps to fix these vulnerabilities.

### Why do we need penetration testing?

It is important for several reasons:

- By mimicking real attackers, penetration testers can **identify vulnerabilities** before malicious actors do and **provide solutions** to fix these vulnerabilities.
- Using an external tester **eliminates implicit biases and assumptions**, avoids conflict of interest, and uncovers security flaws that may be overlooked internally.
- The **cost** to secure yourself from an attack is far cheaper than the consequences of an attack.
- Evaluates the **quality** of existing policies, tools and procedures
- Evaluates **incident response measures** by measuring how well the security team detects, responds to, and mitigates attacks.
- As attack techniques evolve, penetration tests help companies **adapt and defend** against emerging threats and vulnerabilities

### How can you improve your security?

The first step to great security for the company is to first protect yourself, here are some simple ways to improve your overall security.

1. Multi Factor Authentication – see the rule [Security - Do you have MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) enabled?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/multi-factor-authentication-enabled/)
2. Use Password Managers – Use password managers to generate and fill passwords, see the rule [Do you use a password manager?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/password-manager/)
3. Lock your laptop when you leave your desk – check out [DynamicLock](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-feature-dynamic-lock) (windows only), See the rule [Do you lock your computer when leaving your workstation?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/lock-your-computer-when-you-leave/)
4. Avoid malware – This may sound obvious, but not clicking on suspicious links, making sure the person is who they say they are, see the rule [Does your team understand the dangers of social engineering?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/understand-the-dangers-of-social-engineering/)
5. Report potential breaches – whether it’d be personal or company – to SysAdmins, see the rule [Passwords - Do you know how to handle compromised passwords?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/security-compromised-password/)
