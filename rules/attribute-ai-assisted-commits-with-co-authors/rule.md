When AI assistants make code changes on your behalf, proper commit practices are essential. Clear, frequent commits ensure transparency about what was implemented and maintain accurate contribution history.

This practice is especially important in team environments where AI assists with implementing features, fixing bugs, or making changes based on requests from team members.

### The Problem with Missing Attribution

When AI makes changes without proper attribution, we don't know who checked the work of the AI:

::: greybox
**Git History:**
````
feat: Add authentication module
Author: GitHub Copilot <noreply@github.com>
````
:::
::: bad
Bad Example - No indication of who checked the AI's work
:::

### The Problem with Giant End-of-Session Commits

When you don't commit frequently during a Copilot session:

::: greybox
**Single massive commit at the end:**
````
feat: Complete authentication system

- Add login page
- Add registration page
- Add password reset
- Add email verification
- Add OAuth providers
- Add user profile page
- Update database schema
- Add API endpoints
- Add tests
- Update documentation
- Fix styling issues
- Refactor validation logic
````

**Issues:**
- 47 files changed, 3,421 insertions(+), 892 deletions(-)
- Impossible to review effectively
- Can't revert specific changes
- Lost context about which changes relate to which sub-tasks
- No connection to [task documentation](keep-task-summaries-from-ai-assisted-development) created during the session
:::
::: bad
Bad Example - One giant commit makes it hard to understand the work progression and loses the relationship to task docs
:::

## The Solution: Frequent, Focused Commits

Small, focused commits create a clear and reviewable history. Combined with proper attribution of who implemented the changes, this provides transparency and maintainability.

### The Benefits of This Approach

**Clear Attribution:**
- Shows who implemented and verified the changes
- Transparent implementation history

**Small, Vertical Commits:**
- Each commit represents one logical change
- Easy to review and understand
- Can revert specific changes without affecting others
- Clear progression of work

**Connection to Task Documentation:**
- Commits align with [task documentation](keep-task-summaries-from-ai-assisted-development) created during the session
- Easy to cross-reference commit history with task docs
- Provides complete context for future developers

::: greybox
**Better approach - Multiple focused commits:**
````
feat: Add login page with form validation

Author: Gordon Beeming <gordon@example.com>
---
feat: Add user registration with email verification

Author: Gordon Beeming <gordon@example.com>
---
feat: Add OAuth provider integration (Google, GitHub)

Author: Gordon Beeming <gordon@example.com>
---
docs: Document authentication implementation

Updates task doc with OAuth setup details

Author: Gordon Beeming <gordon@example.com>
````

**Result:**
- 4 focused commits instead of 1 giant commit
- Each commit is reviewable independently
- Clear relationship to task documentation
- Easy to understand the implementation sequence

Good Example - Small, focused commits with proper attribution and documentation

### Commit Message Format

Use clear, conventional commit messages:
````bash
git commit -m "type: Brief description"
````

::: good
Good Example - Clear attribution shows who implemented the changes
:::

### Single Commit Example

::: greybox
````bash
git commit -m "feat: Add recipe search functionality"
````

**Git History Shows:**
- **Author:** Gordon Beeming

**Result:** Clear visibility of who implemented and verified the changes
:::
::: good
Good Example - The implementer is properly credited
:::

## When to Commit

### ✅ DO Commit Frequently For:

- **Completed features**: After implementing a logical unit of functionality
- **Bug fixes**: After fixing and testing an issue
- **Documentation updates**: After updating docs or task documentation
- **Refactoring**: After completing a refactoring effort
- **Test additions**: After adding or updating tests
- **Safety checkpoints**: Before making major changes

### ❌ DON'T Create Giant Commits:

- **End-of-session dumps**: Avoid committing all changes at once
- **Mixing concerns**: Don't combine unrelated changes in one commit
- **Untested changes**: Don't commit without verifying the code works

## Implementation for GitHub Copilot CLI

### Configure Copilot Instructions

Add this section to your `.github/copilot-instructions.md`:
````markdown
## Git Commit Guidelines

### Commit Frequently
Commit changes incrementally as you complete logical units of work.

**Why commit frequently:**
- ✅ Creates small, focused commits that are easy to review and understand
- ✅ Enables vertical slicing - each commit represents a single logical change
- ✅ Avoids one giant commit at the end of a session with dozens of unrelated changes
- ✅ Makes it easier to track progress and document work in [task docs created](task-docs-created)
- ✅ Allows reverting specific changes without losing other work
- ✅ Provides clear checkpoints during development

**When to commit:**
- ✅ After adding a new feature or component
- ✅ After fixing a bug
- ✅ After updating documentation (including task documentation)
- ✅ After refactoring code
- ✅ Before making major changes (safety checkpoint)
- ✅ After successful test runs

**Exception:** Do not commit when working on the `gitbutler/workspace` branch - GitButler manages commits on this branch.

**Commit Format:**
```bash
git commit -m "type: Brief description"
```

**Example:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add recipe search functionality"
```
````

## Benefits

This practice provides:

✅ **Proper Credit:** Clear attribution of who implemented the changes  
✅ **Transparency:** Clear record of what was implemented and when  
✅ **Implementation History:** Easy to trace when features were added  
✅ **Small, Reviewable Commits:** Focused changes instead of giant end-of-session commits  
✅ **Vertical Slicing:** Each commit represents one logical unit of work  
✅ **Task Documentation Alignment:** Commits correspond to [task docs created](task-docs-created) during the session  
✅ **Team Visibility:** Clear view of development progress  
✅ **GitHub Insights:** Contribution graphs reflect actual work  
✅ **Future Context:** Helps understand "what" was implemented  
✅ **Easy Reverting:** Can undo specific changes without affecting other work

### GitHub UI Benefits

When you commit frequently with clear messages, GitHub automatically:

- Shows the progression of work over time
- Provides detailed commit history
- Links commits to pull requests and issues
- Enables effective code review

::: greybox
**GitHub Commit View:**
````
feat: Add authentication module

Author: Gordon Beeming
````

**Shows:**
- Clear indication of who implemented the feature
- Easy navigation through commit history
- Links to related issues and PRs
:::
::: good
Good Example - GitHub displays clear implementation history
:::

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Feature Implementation

::: greybox
**GitHub Issue #42:**
"Add dark mode support to the dashboard"

**Your commit:**
````bash
git commit -m "feat: Implement dark mode toggle

Closes #42"
````
:::
::: good
Good Example - Clear attribution and issue reference
:::

### Scenario 2: Bug Fix

::: greybox
**PR Review Comment:**
"The validation logic has a bug when email field is empty"

**Your commit:**
````bash
git commit -m "fix: Handle empty email validation correctly"
````
:::
::: good
Good Example - Clear description of what was fixed
:::

### Scenario 3: Copilot CLI Implementation

::: greybox
**Command:**
````bash
copilot_here "add TypeScript types for all API responses"
````

**Copilot commits:**
````bash
git commit -m "feat: Add TypeScript types for API responses"
````

**Result:** Clear history of type safety improvements
:::
::: good
Good Example - Descriptive commit message shows what was implemented
:::

## Conclusion

Proper commit practices are essential when AI assists with code changes. By committing frequently with clear messages, you:

- Ensure transparent implementation history
- Maintain reviewable, focused commits
- Provide context for future developers
- Support accurate progress tracking

This practice transforms AI assistance from a black box into a transparent development tool, showing what was implemented and when.

Remember: **Commit early, commit often, and keep commits focused.**
